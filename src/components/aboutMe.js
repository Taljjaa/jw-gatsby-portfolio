    <div>
      Hello, my name is Jennifer Williams. I am a self taught front end
      developer based in Seattle. I graduated with a degree in Zoology but fell
      in love with coding after taking a Java class in my free time. When I'm
      not coding I enjoy reading manga, practicing Japanese, and playing board
      games.
